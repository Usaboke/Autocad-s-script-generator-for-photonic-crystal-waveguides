# Autocad-s-script-generator-for-photonic-crystal-waveguides by Wei Dai
# Appliable to all sorts of triangular lattices and honeycomb lattices
# Both bulk lattice and waveguides with defects can be ceated easily by changing parameters
# Optimized for photonic crystal wavegide fabrication with addons to connect silicon wires
# Complex geomeries such as 9-times bent waveguides are available
